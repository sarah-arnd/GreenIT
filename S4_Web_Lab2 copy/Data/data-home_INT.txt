What is Green IT?
The concept of digital sobriety or green IT or sustainable IT or eco-IT is a relatively new concept and a new way of thinking.
      
Green IT's main objective:

Minimize energy consumption
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions


What impact does digital technology have on the environment?

Carbon footprint or the carbon content of a human activity is a measure of the greenhouse gas emissions of anthropogenic origin, i.e. that can be attributed to it. It depends on the emission factors of the inputs linked to this activity, and in particular on the emission factors associated with CO2 emissions.


Energy impact on web development
Why do websites have a carbon footprint?

Every website has its own carbon footprint, i.e. the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the process of creating and maintaining it.
Your website's carbon footprint corresponds to the amount of CO2 emissions it created during its lifetime.
The larger your website's carbon footprint, the greater the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.

What is the carbon footprint of a web page?

Browsing online and visiting websites requires electrical energy. This has a significant ecological impact.
On average, a web page consulted produces 1.76 grams of CO2, and 7 grams for a Google search.
The design and number of visits to a website largely influence the weight of its carbon emissions.
