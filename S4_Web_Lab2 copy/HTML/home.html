    <h1>What is Green IT?</h1>
        <p id = "definition"> 
            The concept of digital sobriety or green IT or sustainable IT or eco-IT is a relatively new concept and a new way of thinking.

    <h2>Green IT's main objective:</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>Minimize energy consumption</li>
    <li>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What impact does digital technology have on the environment? </h2>
    
    <p>Carbon footprint or the carbon content of a human activity is a measure of the greenhouse <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas>gas emissions</a> of anthropogenic origin, i.e. that can be attributed to it. It depends on the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity>emission factors</a> of the inputs linked to this activity, and in particular on the emission factors associated with <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions>CO2 emissions</a>.</p>

    <h2>Energy impact on web development</h2>
    <h3>Why do websites have a carbon footprint?</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Every website has its own carbon footprint, i.e. the amount of greenhouse <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas>gas emissions</a> generated by the process of creating and maintaining it.</li>
    <li>Your website's carbon footprint corresponds to the amount of CO2 emissions it created during its lifetime.</li>
    <li>The larger your website's carbon footprint, the greater the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is the carbon footprint of a web page?</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Browsing online and visiting websites requires electrical energy. This has a significant ecological impact.</li>
    <li>On average, a web page consulted produces 1.76 grams of CO2, and 7 grams for a Google search.</li>
    <li>The design and number of visits to a website largely influence the weight of its carbon emissions.</li>
    </ul>
